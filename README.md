# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project
Heart Disease Prediction is a machine learning project that analyzes medical data to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. The model is trained on a structured dataset and uses features like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure to make predictions. The goal is to support early diagnosis through data-driven insights.
