# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using machine learning models. It uses a structured dataset with features such as age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more to train and evaluate predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file (`Heart Disease Data.csv`) containing medical information of patients, with the target column indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

## Notebook

- `Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb`: Contains the full workflow including:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
  - Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Objective

The objective is to build a predictive model that can help in identifying patients at risk of heart disease based on clinical features, aiding early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Make sure `Heart Disease Data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the models.
